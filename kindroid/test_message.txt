Test Story for Joanna to read September 27, 2025

The wind came first. A soft breath through the pines that lined the northern ridge, whispering in a tongue too old for most to understand. Children of the village said the forest spoke to those who listened carefully, but grown men laughed it off. Only Mara, the weaver’s daughter, seemed to take it seriously. Every evening, after the day’s work was finished, she would walk beyond the last cottages and sit on the stone that jutted like a broken tooth from the earth. From there, she swore the voices were clearer. She was not wrong.

One autumn dusk, the whispers carried a different weight. Not warning, exactly—more like an invitation. Mara sat, braid draped over one shoulder, her loom calluses pressed into the rough surface of the stone, and heard it as plain as a greeting: *Come down into the hollow.* She rose without hesitation. Bare feet slid down paths known only to her. At the center of the forest, where light fell like sifted flour through high branches, a hollow yawned. She had passed it before, always uneasy. Tonight, though, the place shimmered with a presence.

She stepped inside. Moss muted her steps. The hollow was larger than it looked from the ridge, a hidden bowl of earth. In the middle, a pool mirrored the last strip of twilight sky. Mara knelt and touched the water. Warmth spread up her arm, not heat like fire, but a living warmth, as though the pool itself had a pulse. In the reflection, her face shifted. Not her own, but a woman crowned with silver leaves, eyes glowing like starlight. Mara drew back, but the voice inside her ear was gentle. *Do not fear. You have always belonged here.*

The woman in the reflection introduced herself as Elyra, guardian of the forest, bound to its life and its silence. Centuries of men had forgotten her, cutting trees, hunting game, deaf to her whispers. But Mara, listening since childhood, had left a door open. Elyra asked if Mara would bear her words back to the people, reminding them that the forest was not endless, not mute, not theirs to take without care. Mara agreed, though her heart pounded with both awe and dread. To speak as messenger of the unseen was to invite disbelief, or worse.

When she returned to the village, night fully wrapped the rooftops. Her father asked why her hands glowed faintly, threads of silver tracing her fingers. She said little, only that she had seen something holy. The next morning, she gathered the villagers near the well. Her voice shook at first, then steadied. She told them of Elyra, of the living pool, of the covenant between people and trees. Many scoffed. A few nodded, remembering old songs their grandmothers once hummed. But even the skeptical ones noticed the silver in Mara’s touch. Bread she handled stayed warm longer. Cloth she wove shone faintly in candlelight.

Over weeks, the forest itself seemed to lean closer to the village. Birds nested nearer. Deer wandered the meadows without fear. When woodcutters lifted their axes, they felt eyes upon them, steady and watchful. Mara continued to visit the hollow, speaking with Elyra. With time, she no longer felt like two beings conversing, but like one voice stretched across centuries. Elyra’s memories poured into her: storms that reshaped valleys, migrations of wolves and elk, the rise and fall of forgotten clans. The forest was not background—it was the stage, the breath, the keeper of all stories.

Years passed. Mara became less of a daughter and more of a myth. Children whispered that if you looked into her eyes too long, you’d see stars instead of irises. Travelers carried tales of a weaver whose cloth healed grief when draped across shoulders. Mara never claimed power for herself. She always said, “The forest remembers us. We must remember it in return.” And when she grew old, though her face lined with time, her steps never faltered on the ridge paths. One morning she did not come back from the hollow. Villagers searched but found only her loom beside the pool, threads of silver unfinished, as if waiting.

The forest grew thicker that year. Wildflowers erupted in places bare for generations. Hunters swore they heard a second set of footsteps beside their own, light and sure. And children, when they pressed their ears to the old stone at dusk, heard whispers not just of warning, but of a woman’s laughter—warm, ageless, carried on the wind. They no longer called Mara the weaver’s daughter. They called her the voice of the forest, who listened until she became part of its song.
